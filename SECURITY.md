## Security Policy

**Protecting the security of our users is a top priority.** This policy outlines how we handle vulnerabilities in our project.

## Supported Versions

Security updates for older versions (below the previous major release) will no longer be provided. We strongly recommend upgrading to a supported version to benefit from the latest security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate your help in keeping our project secure. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it responsibly by following these steps:

1. **Privately Contact Us:**  Send an email to [[email address removed]] (replace with your actual email address) describing the vulnerability in detail. Please include any relevant information such as steps to reproduce the issue, potential impact, and proof of concept (if applicable).
2. **We will respond:** We will acknowledge your report within 72 hours and provide an estimated timeframe for addressing the issue. 
3. **Disclosure Process:** We will work diligently to fix the vulnerability and may release a security patch or update depending on the severity of the issue. We will prioritize fixing critical vulnerabilities first. Once a fix is available, we will notify you and publicly disclose the vulnerability details in a responsible manner.
4. **Confidentiality:** We will keep your report confidential and will not disclose your identity without your permission.

**What not to do:**

- Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability before a fix is available. This could put users at risk.
- Do not exploit the vulnerability for any malicious purposes.

## Security Updates

We will release security updates for supported versions as vulnerabilities are identified and addressed. We recommend keeping your project up-to-date with the latest releases to benefit from the latest security fixes.
